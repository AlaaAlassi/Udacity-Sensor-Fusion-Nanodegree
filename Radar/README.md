This project uses radar to generate a perception for a self-driving car, covering topics like signal propagation, target response generation, Range Doppler generation, etc.

### I. Preparation on Ubuntu

Radar exercises and projects will be completed using MATLAB. It is required to register a MathWorks account [here](https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register). Verify the email and log on the account, then download the installer for Ubuntu [here](https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/udacity_sf_radar/). If the license expiration date is ending soon, we can contact Udacity for an extension [support@udacity.com](support@udacity.com).

Unzip the `matlab_R2020b_glnxa64.zip` and run the installation script with sudo.
```bash
$ sudo ./install
$ ./matlab
```
