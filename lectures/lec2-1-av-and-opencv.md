# Lesson 2-1 Autonomous Driving and OpenCV

This lesson will give an introduction about the autonomous driving and computer vision.



### I. Levels of Autonomous Driving

For years, there are many vehicles on the road equipped with *Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)*, which assist the driver in various driving tasks, such as *Forward Collision Warning (FCW)*, *Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)*, etc. But they only provide some degree of automation in a selected number of driving situations, e.g. highways, etc. The driver still must remain engaged in during the driving and monitor the environment.

For an automation Level 3 and above, the drivers are no longer required to monitor the environment, even though they must be available to take back the control at all times. Therefore, it means the responsibility for the driving tasks is with the car company/manufacturer from a legal viewpoint.

The graph below from the NHTSA website shows the *Levels of autonomous driving* defined by the SAE.
