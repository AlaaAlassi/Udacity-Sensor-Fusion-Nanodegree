# Lesson 2-3 Tracking Image Features

This lesson will show how to identify and track reliable and stable features through a sequence of images.
1. Locate keypionts (point of interest)



### I. Intensity Gradient and Filtering

The majority of the keypoint types is the distribution of brightness information over the image. High intensity gradient indicates the brightness changes rapidly, and those places might therefore be suitable keypoints.

Mathematically, the gradient is the partial derivative of the image intensity into both *x* and *y* direction. The **approximation of gradient** would be the intensity differences between neighboring pixels, divided by the distance between those pixels. We can also compute the **direction** as well as the **magnitude** of the intensity gradient vector.
